               The Crescent Nebula, or NGC 6888 is an emission nebula that spans roughly 25 Light Years in diameter. NGC 6888 is located roughly 5000 Light Years away in the constellation Cygnus. The Crescent Nebula is the product of a type of star known as a “Wolf-Rayet”, which are massive objects that are aging and shed their mass at extreme rates. This Wolf-Rayet is shedding its outer layers at a pace of the mass of our Sun every 10,000 years. It is believed that the star in the center of NGC 6888 will eventually end its life in a violent explosion known as a Supernova.

                The Eagle's nebula is an active star forming region in the Serpens constellation. This nebula spans 70 x 50 Lightyears and is about 5.5 Million years old. Inside a nebula like this, gravity pulls gas inwards towards the center and if enough is present, nuclear fusion ignites and the compacted cloud becomes a new star. The Eagle nebula is also home to the famous Pillars of Creation.

            The North American Nebula is an ionized-hydrogen region within the Cygnus constellation. located about 1,700 Lightyears from the sun, this nebula lies in the Orion arm of the Milky Way. With a diameter of 100 Lightyears, the North American Nebula is roughly 587.86 Trillion miles wide. This nebula was given its name due to its resemblance to the continent of North America. If you could see this with your naked eye, it would cover the same area of 10 full moons in the night sky.

                The Elephant's Trunk Nebula is located in the constellation Cepheus, within the giant interstellar gas cloud known as IC 1396. The Nebula is located at the bottom part of the cloud, reaching up towards the middle. The Elephant's trunk is 20 Lightyears long, while the gas cloud it is located in is roughly 100 Lightyears across, which makes IC 1396 one of the largest nebula in the North American sky.

The Lagoon (M8) and Trifid (M20) Nebula are located at the spout of the "teapot" in the Sagittarius constellation. Sagittarius is located in the densest part of the Milky Way core.The brighter ball on the left is the Trifid Nebula, which is a larger, but further nebula. The area the Lagoon nebula covers is 55 x 110 Lightyears, but does not appear this way to us since it is roughly 5,200 Lightyears from the Earth. With a magnitude of 6, this is the darkest a deep-sky object can be viewable with the naked eye, given you have exceptional eyesight. Looking at the night sky, the Lagoon nebula would be as large as two full moons. Both nebulas are comprised of mostly ionized Hydrogen gas. When the energy from new or dying stars passes through these giant clouds of Hydrogen, it ionizes the gas which makes it glow. When the energy is low, it will glow with a red tint. The darker parts of these nebula are where most of their stars are being formed.

The Veil Nebula is a cloud of heated and ionized gas in the Cygnus constellation.
This Nebula is a supernova remnant of a star 20 times the size of our sun roughly 2,400 Lightyears away, that exploded around 10,000 years ago. An explosion of this magnitude was visible in daylight, and would have been about the size of Venus. The bright colors you see (Red - Ionized Hydrogen, Blue - Ionized Oxygen) are a result of the extreme force of the explosion, moving debris to speeds of around 370,000 miles-per-hour which create shock-waves that heat the surrounding gas to millions of degrees. It is the subsequent cooling of the gas that creates such vibrant colors. Although only about one star per century in the milky way will end its life in such spectacular fashion, these explosions are responsible for make all elements heavier than Iron, as well as being the main producers of Oxygen in the Universe. Metal elements such as Copper, Mercury and Gold are forged in explosions like the one that created the Veil Nebula. The elements that created Earth, and that are inside every one of us, were created from and distributed by supernovas just like the one you see here.

            M13 or the Great Cluster of Hercules is located 25,100 Lightyears away and contains roughly 300,000 stars. M13 is 145 Lightyears in diameter (or 852,400,679,111,622 miles wide) and is 11.65 billion years old. The cluster was discovered in 1714 by Edmond Halley, and was a recipient of an interstellar message (known as the Aricebo message) sent out in 1974. This area was picked as the probability of intelligent life living here is higher than other parts of the Milky Way.

           The Moon is the brightest object in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of -12.6 (negative numbers are the brightest). Earth’s moon is responsible for stabilizing the Earth’s axis wobble, which makes the planet’s climate relatively steady. The Moon is also responsible for the tides on earth, which have influenced life from its very beginning stages. Although it is not certain, it is theorized that the Moon formed after a Mars-sized body collides with the Earth billions of years ago. The Moon is the 5th largest moon out of a total of 200 in our solar system. Human’s named this moon “The Moon” because at the time they didn’t know any other moons existed. This changed in 1610 when Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter. The Moon is the only other planetary object that humans have ever stepped foot on.
